## Overview

This example creates an employee directory with React. This application breaks up the UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

## Details

The following components have been created and make up the UI.

  * Navbar
  * API
  * Employee

The API component includes the following api call, [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/), on page load.  This call generates an array of objects representing employees.  

The Employee component returns a display of employees in a table format.  For this example, [react-bootstrap-table-next](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-bootstrap-table-next), with the toolkit provider [react-bootstrap-table2-toolkit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-bootstrap-table2-toolkit) is used.  The react bootstrap tookkit provides the sorting, searching and filtering capablilites for our table component.
